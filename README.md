Nuke Python Scripts

ShareNodes:
Inspired from XCopy from Mill Legacy pipeline which allows to share nuke nodes between user to user after discarding it while moving in to MPC pipeline. So I've decided to build my own script along with few additional feature like option to add multiple users. This scripts works with any pipeline only need to pass a folder structure or a file where all the targeted user names are stored and a path to save the shared scripts. Used PySide2.

Grid Tools:
I always love to organize my script and needed a shortcut to access all the grid options without much of struggle so I built my own script to toggle grid visibility and scale the grid.

Hijack_Paste.py:
While working as a Comp Lead it was becoming a bit difficult to avoid from preventing artists to copy the read nodes multiple times so I've written a small script which will hijack default past (clipboard) and creates postage stamps for all the read nodes from the clipboard. Also included script to keep postage stamps connections intact while copying postage stamps. It won't change anything for rest of the nodes.

Open Save Scripts:
This was my practice scripts in which I tried to recreate nuke file saving method from MPC pipeline. Used PySide2.

Scale Tree:
I needed a shortcut to scale selected nodes in nuke so created this.

 project structure:
Again one of my practice scripts where I've written a script using PySide to crate folder structure
